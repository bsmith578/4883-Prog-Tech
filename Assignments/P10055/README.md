### Description:

This program reads in two numbers from each line of input. These numbers indicate the number of soldiers in Hashmat's army
and the number of soldiers in the enemy army, where Hashmat never has more soldiers than the enemy. The purpose of this
program is to calculate the difference in size of both armys and print each difference on a new line.
